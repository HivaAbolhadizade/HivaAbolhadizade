## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, passionate about AI and building smart systems that solve real-world problems.
My journey began with a deep dive into Machine Learning through university courses, and since then, I've been working on hands-on projects in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP.

I’m deeply curious by nature, always excited to learn new things and put them into practice to solve challenging problems.
Right now, I'm focused on mastering Deep Learning through a structured, topic-rich curriculum — exploring everything from neural networks and optimization to Transformers, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Self-Supervised Learning.

I enjoy contributing to open-source, exploring how machines learn, and experimenting with tools like PyTorch.
Currently exploring: AI for Healthcare and Human-like reasoning in AI systems.

Always up for collaboration — check out my projects below or drop me a message!
