## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, passionate about AI and building smart systems that solve real-world problems.
My journey began with a deep dive into Machine Learning through university courses, and since then, I've been working on hands-on projects in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP.

I enjoy contributing to open-source, exploring how machines learn, and experimenting with tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
Currently exploring: AI for Healthcare and Human-like reasoning in AI systems.

Always up for collaboration — check out my projects below or drop me a message!
